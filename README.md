This repository contains various resources and now includes a small placeholder web site based on the project Figma design.

## Viewing the placeholder site

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the repository root.
2. Start a simple HTTP server. With Python installed, you can run:
   
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```
3. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:8000/site/` to see the site.

The site currently includes placeholder HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that reference screenshots from the Figma design. As the project evolves, these files can be replaced with the final assets.
